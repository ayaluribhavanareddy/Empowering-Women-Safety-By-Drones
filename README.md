# Empowering-Women-Safety-By-Drones
This project addresses the safety concerns in red alert areas where women face numerous risks, including physical violence, sexual assault, trafficking, and harassment. Our solution deploys autonomous drones equipped with sophisticated sensors and alert mechanisms to detect suspicious activities and assist in traffic management.
